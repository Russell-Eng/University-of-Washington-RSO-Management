                    <p>
                        The Technology and Business Association was founded in Seattle as a non-profit organization in
                        March 2013 by a
                        group of
                        UW students. Currently, we have about 1600 members in the Seattle area and 400 members in
                        Minnesota. We aim to
                        promote
                        connections between UW students and the professionals in the Great Seattle Area and to offer
                        smooth transitions
                        between
                        academic and different industries. In particular, we want to explore the possibilities and
                        philosophies
                        resulting from
                        the collision between technology and business. We are here to help everyone improve their
                        leadership skills, to
                        provide
                        professional education and various internship opportunities, and to foster future leaders within
                        a variety of
                        disciplines.

                    <p>Since the advent of the pandemic, we have gradually acclimated to a new form of living -- from

                        courses to working at home for traditionally on-site jobs. The pandemic has compelled us to
                        ponder in new perspectives,
                        how we interact and socialize with others while abiding by guidelines for maintaining an apt
